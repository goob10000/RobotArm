# Robot Arm Project!

Based on the design [here](https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/scara-robot-how-to-build-your-own-arduino-based-robot/) with a redesigned gripper using a rack and pinion model and my own software, I've been able to build a robot arm and nearly finished writing software to move it. It is not contained in this project, but I also used arduino code for runnning the motors on the arm itself and this code will direct the arduino in running the robot arm:
